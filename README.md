AI-Assisted ECG Analysis Webpage
This project is a promotional webpage for an AI-assisted ECG analysis system, designed to highlight its capabilities in diagnosing heart failure and heart attacks with high accuracy, speed, and security. The webpage is built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js, and is based on a provided PDF presentation.
Features

Fast & Accurate Diagnosis: Showcases the system's ability to diagnose heart conditions in 10 seconds with 90.5% accuracy.
Seamless Integration: Highlights compatibility with standard 12-lead ECG machines, EMR, and PACS systems.
Secure On-Premise Solution: Emphasizes the on-premise AI server for enhanced security and performance.
Visual Comparison: Includes a bar chart comparing the accuracy of AITiA LVSD (0.905) vs. NT-proBNP (0.720).
Research Credibility: Mentions support from 59 peer-reviewed publications.

Technologies

React: For dynamic, reusable components.
Tailwind CSS: For responsive and modern styling.
Chart.js: For visualizing diagnostic accuracy.
Babel: For in-browser JSX transpilation.

Setup

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-ecg-webpage.git


Navigate to the project directory:cd ai-ecg-webpage


Open index.html in a modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to view the webpage. No build step is required as it uses CDN-hosted libraries.

Deployment
To deploy on GitHub Pages:

Ensure the repository is public or private with GitHub Pages enabled.
Push the code to the main branch:git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main


Go to the repository settings on GitHub, navigate to the "Pages" section, and set the source to the main branch.
Access the deployed site at https://your-username.github.io/ai-ecg-webpage.

Notes

The webpage relies on CDNs for React, ReactDOM, Babel, Chart.js, and Tailwind CSS. Ensure internet connectivity for local testing.
For production, consider using a build tool like Vite to bundle dependencies and optimize performance.
Check the browser console (F12 > Console) for any errors if the page doesn't render.
